    about_p1: 'In todayâ€™s world, where data is ubiquitous, we view data accessibility as a basic human right. The Sensory Interface project aims to provide an interface to numerical data for any purpose, be it Scientific Research, Software Development, Education etc.',
    about_p2: 'This data is typically visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc. You could think of these visualizations as the visual interface to the data. We aim to provide a multi-sensory interface to the data. This interface uses sound and touch, in addition to the visual channel, as a means to convey the same underlying data.' ,
    about_p3: 'Our hope is that by doing this, we will make work in fields such as Scientific Research, Data Science and Machine Learning accessible to people with certain disabilities.',
