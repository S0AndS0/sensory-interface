## The Sensory Interface project


The Sensory Interface project <a href="https://sensoryinterface.com">sensoryinterface.com</a> aims to help people with blindness access data such as graphs and other complex numerical data.


In todayâ€™s world, data accessibility is a basic human right.


Data is often visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc, which are inaccessible to blind people. We aim to provide the accessible alternative - a multi-sensory interface to the data. This interface uses sound and touch, in addition to the visual channel, as a means to convey the same underlying data.


Our hope is that this project will unlock high-quality employment opportunities for blind people in fields such as Data Science, Finance, Scientific Research, Education and others.
